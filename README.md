### Lore
#### Background Story
  Year 2153, it was 30 years before first civil war between organics and mechanics emerged in
history. Technology became so advanced in the 22th Century that some people began to use
cybernetic implants to made them more stronger or more advantageous than regular human
beings. On the other hand, robot population started an uprising just before the civil war.
Although the cybernetic implants designed to make humans stronger, they did not always
succeed and this failure gave birth a new kind of creature. There are now a group of people
who suffered severe consequences of this implants, makes them look like monstrous
mutants. All these four type of members of society separated from each other after the civil
war. Yet they haven't knew the path they need to cross soon.
  
  In the Year of 2153, an alien like creature attacked the heart of the Palm City and its army
spread all parts of the city. Explosion also changed the weather conditions in the city. In the first moments 
of this invasion you are given the chance to choose between 4 different type of class to kill the alien boss
and save the city.

#### Classes
**Robot**: They began to live in Andromeda Hills where the weather is almost every time
snowy and cold which makes them more powerful against organic life forms and they use this
as an advantage against the monster that instill terror to Palm City.

**Cyborg**: They are certainly not humans and certainly not robots also, they do not live in the
cities anymore after the civil war and they do not prefer to live with robots in those cold
weather. They are located in Calypso Valley, a place where a lot of tech companies were located 
back then. They have enough supplies for themselves in case of repairing and hot, coastal weather. 
These conditions enable cyborgs to defend themselves against organic looters and attacks from them.

**Mutant**: they are excluded from every possible society, therefore, they found themselves in
Ladercom Slums where they can resist acid rains and mud. They are completely on their
own, yet their uncontrollable strength and an area which they use for their advantage makes
the territory most challenging place both for the monsters and other classes

**Humans**: After getting rid of from all freaks, humans created an utopia city for their own in the
Palm City, where they call Paradise City. Humans created an atmosphere device where
they keep the weather on ideal temperature for humans only. However, city is only
protected by walls and by having fragile architecture they had the most damage from the invasion
